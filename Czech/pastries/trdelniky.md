## Prep Time

45 min

## Bake Time

15-25 min @ 400F

## Steps

1. In a small bowl, proof the yeast for ~10 min with 1t sugar and 0.25C warm milk.
2. In medium mixing bowl, mix the sugar & flour.
3. In large mixing bowl, mix 2 eggs, butter and proofed yeast.
4. Slowly mix in sugar+flour mixture into the large bowl. (Drys into wets when baking!)
5. Add in remaining 0.25C warm milk, mix on low speed until blended.
6. Knead dough for 5 min. One of those Kitchen Aids with a hook will work, too.
7. Let dough rise for 30 min. Keep it warm and damp. I used a radiator and a wet towel I heated in the microwave draped over the bowl.
8. Cover the jars in aluminum foil. 3 Tips I discovered from trial and error: Don't cover the ridge! The foil won't want to come off the hot jars and you'll damage the Ttrdelník trying to get it off. Also, roll the end into a long point so you have something to pull on to get it off the hot jar. Lightly butter the foil.
9. In large bowl, make cinnamon sugar: mix 0.5C sugar + 2t ground cinnamon. Pour out onto paper plate and set aside.
10. Cover pan in parchment paper and attach with binder clips.
11. Preheat oven to 400F
12. Make egg wash in small bowl: whisk 1t water + 1 egg. Set aside.
13. Cut risen dough in half and make two dough balls. Then cut each into quarters so you have 8 evenly-sized pieces, even if you are only making 4 big trdelníky. Otherwise, the dough will be too hard to handle.
14. Make dough snakes with your hands! Roll the pieces of dough between your palms, and press hard to make the dough stretch out. Each strand should be 2-3ft long, and about the size of a finger.
15. Holding the greased jars upside down and without their lids, neatly spiral wrap each dough strand around the foil-covered jars. Start from just below the ridge, and wrap toward the bottom of the jar. Don't leave large gaps or tears. For large trdelníky, use 2 strands on a single 12oz jar, joining the ends by pressing one onto another. This recipe will make 4 large trdelníky.
16. Evenly baste the trdelníky in the egg wash, roll them in cinnamon sugar, and place them on the baking sheet spaced evenly with the top of the jar downward.
17. Bake at 400F for 15-25 min. Keep a very watchful eye on them!
18. Remove from HOT jars by gently pulling the aluminum foil off the jar, and discarding the aluminum.
19. Enjoy warm! Re-heat in microwave on 80% power for 20-30 seconds.
20. Dobrou Chuť!
